# Hello ðŸ‘‹

I'm Heng. I embarked on my journey as a web developer in 2017, and over the years, I've cultivated a strong professional background in web development, design, and security. I thrive on collaboration, maintain a structured and organized approach to my work, and excel in problem-solving. My passion for development drives me to continually enhance my skills throughout the development process, ensuring that the solutions I create are modern, user-friendly, robust, and secure.

I'm actively involved in open-source development and have shared my insights through professional articles on various platforms like my website, Google Local Guide, LinkedIn, Facebook, YouTube, and Blogger.

My expertise lies in creating engaging experiences with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. While I enjoy exploring new technologies, I specialize in Angular, Java Spring Boot, and MS SQL Server. On a lighter note, I'm a gamer and the proud owner of the In Time Gaming Brand.

In my free time, I have a few hobbies, including motorbike riding, working out, music appreciation, Donghau, and gaming.
