# Hello, World! ðŸ‘‹

## About Me

Greetings,

I'm Heng, hailing from Chi Phat Village in Koh Kong Province. I hold a bachelor's degree in Web Programming from the University of Puthisastra. Currently, I'm working as a System Development Supervisor at Fortune Life Insurance PLC.

My core values revolve around equality, respect, and the eradication of racism. I firmly believe in treating everyone with respect and dignity, regardless of their background or social status. Time management is a priority for me, and I'm committed to continuous learning and staying updated in my field. During my free time, I find joy in music, movies, exercise, and writing.

Lastly, I express my immense gratitude to Passerelles Numeriques Cambodia for providing me with a 100% scholarship and outstanding career opportunities. This organization empowers underprivileged students in remote areas to pursue higher education, and I feel privileged to have been a part of their inspiring initiative.

If you're interested in collaboration, please feel free to reach out to me.

Best regards,
Heng LOEM
