# Greetings ðŸ‘‹

I am Heng, from Koh Kong Province. I hold a bachelor's degree in Web Programming from the University of Puthisastra. I work as a System Development Supervisor in a private company based in Phnom Penh, Cambodia.

I firmly believe in treating everyone with respect and dignity, regardless of their background or social status. Time management is a priority for me, and I'm committed to continuous learning and staying updated in my field. I enjoy music, movies, exercise, and writing during my free time.

Lastly, I express my immense gratitude to Passerelles Numeriques Cambodia for providing me with a 100% scholarship and outstanding career opportunities. This organization empowers underprivileged students in remote areas to pursue higher education, and I feel privileged to have been a part of their inspiring initiative.
If you're interested in collaborating, please feel free to contact me.

Best regards,
Heng LOEM
